# git status

The command `git status` is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, status of your repository.

Using `git status` will show you what changes are being tracked, aren't being tracked, what commits need to be pushed/pulled, etc. It is exactly what is sounds like, a status check.

```
git add .
git status

git commit -m "Modified landing page"
git status

git push
git status
```
